    Summaries are totally optional. In fact, most resumes do not need a summary! Consider this: Your resume is already meant to be a concise summary of your achievements.
     There's no need to re-summarize it in a paragraph form. The key exception to this is if you need to add important information that is not already in another section on your resume.For example, if you're looking to completely change your career & role (e.g. moving from software engineering to marketing), you could use 2-6 lines to direct a recruiter to the specific roles you are looking for.
